VOTING.SOL

Considering the requirements & instructions for creating this Voting System, there was room for interpretation and personal preference.
As such, you will find below the arbitrary decisions I made for my basic implementation: 

- The Admin cannot self-register as voter
- At least 3 voters are needed
- At least 2 proposals are needed
- At least 1 vote is needed
- Ties are not resolved,  in such an event, the proposal with the smaller index wins
- proposalId starts at 1, leaving 0 as default non-existing proposalId


VOTINGPLUS.SOL

In a more advanced version, I implemented the following improvements:

- Voters are now subject to a new vote that determines whether they agree to the Admin takin part in voting & submitting
- Voters can now delegate their vote
- There is a runoff vote for resolving ties


- There is no minimum amount of proposal/vote anymore
- Workflow changes now happen over time automatically
- Adding a history for tracking proposals that won a vote
